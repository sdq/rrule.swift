# rrule.swift
**rrule.swift** supports recurrence rules in Swift 4  (No other 3rd-party dependencies).

It is a partial port of the rrule module from the excellent [python-dateutil](http://labix.org/python-dateutil/) library.

How to use
------
Drag **rrule.swift** into your project. 

	let rule = rule(frequency, dtstart: dtstart, until: until, count: count, interval: interval, wkst: wkst, bysetpos: bysetpos, bymonth: bymonth, bymonthday: bymonthday, byyearday: byyearday, byweekno: byweekno, byweekday: byweekday)
	let occurrences = rule.getOccurrences()

Convert an EKEvent's array of EKRecurrenceRule to an array of rrule to perform calculations

    let eventStore = EKEventStore()
    if let event = eventStore.event(withIdentifier: "id") {
        let rrules = event.rrules
        for rrule in rrules {
            print(rrule.getOccurrences())
        }
    }
